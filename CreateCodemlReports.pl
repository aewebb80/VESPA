=head1 NAME

CreateCodemlReports.pl - Creates a set of reports for a Codeml job. 

=head1 USAGE

perl CreateCodemlReports.pl codeml_workspace report_directory [-alignment=original_alignment] [-tree=tree_of_interest] [-sequence=sequence_of_interest] [-models=model_set] [-omegas=omega_set] [-threshold=pos_site_threshold] [-overwrite=overwrite_option]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CreateCodemlReports.pl searches a Codeml workspace and processes any Codeml output 
found. All reports are saved within the specified report directory.

In the report directory, Codeml summary reports are produced. If trees are specified, 
summary reports are created for those trees. Otherwise, reports are created for all 
trees. An LRT report is also created in each report directory, showing the intermediate
values of the LRT calculations. In addition, a pos site report and pos site MSA are 
produced for every model with inferred positive sites. If one or more sequences are 
specified, pos site reports are created for each sequence in turn. An original 
alignment can be specified if it's desired to map pos sites back to that original 
alignment. If an original alignment is specified, any pos site MSAs will be based  
on the original alignment.

If the specified report directory already exists and the 'overwrite' option isn't 
set, the user is prompted to confirm that (s)he wishes to write reports to that 
directory. Only set an existing directory as the report directory if you know what 
you're doing. 

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item • codeml_workspace

Codeml workspace: a directory structure containing a set of Codeml tasks 
- and in this case, output - associated with a specific Codeml job. 

=item • report_directory

The directory within which Codeml reports are to be saved. 

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item • -alignment=original_alignment

The name of a masked alignment file in 'HTML' format, in which sites that were 
removed before Codeml analysis are instead masked. This allows sites to be mapped 
to their original positions. Note that this will only work with masked alignments 
created by the 'CodemlWrapper::Alignment' module.

=item • -tree=tree_of_interest

The name of a tree of interest. If a tree other than the topology tree is specified, 
homogeneous and site-specific models are reported along with lineage-specific models 
for that tree. If the topology tree is specified, homogeneous and site-specific models 
are reported. If no tree is specified, reports are produced for all trees in the 
Codeml job. 

=item • -sequence=sequence_of_interest

The name of a sequence of interest, or the string 'FOREGROUND'. If 'FOREGROUND' 
is specified, positive sites are reported for every sequence in the foreground. 
If particular sequences are given, positive sites are reported for those sequences. 
If no sequence is given, positive sites are reported as positions in the alignment, 
without amino acid symbols.

=item • -models=model_set

A model to include in the Codeml reports, specified individually on the command 
line or as a list in a text file with extension '.txt'. If no models are specified,
the default models are used.

=item • -omegas=omega_set

An initial omega to include in the Codeml reports, specified individually on 
the command line or as a list in a text file with extension '.txt'. If no omegas
are specified, the default omegas are used.

=item • -threshold=pos_site_threshold

Pos site probability threshold. Pos sites with a probability lower than the 
threshold will be ignored. If no threshold is specified, the default (0.5) will 
be used.

=item • -overwrite=overwrite_option

The overwrite option indicates whether an existing directory should be used as a
report directory. If 'YES', existing directories will be used as a report directory.
If 'NO', specifying an existing directory as a report directory will cause the 
script to fail.
